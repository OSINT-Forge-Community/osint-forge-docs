OSINT Forge is a learning and practice platform. The following rules apply
specifically to OSINT-related activities within the community:

  non-consenting private individuals.

  synthetic, or explicitly authorized datasets.

  Information) of any real individual in discussions, write-ups, or challenges.
- **Ethical methodology.** Practice and promote responsible OSINT techniques
  that respect privacy and legal boundaries.

  applicable laws or platform terms of service.
